There are four access modifiers in java.
-public
-protected
-default
-private
*Variables-Constructors-Methods can take access modifiers.

** Public**
The access level is everywhere.
What does it mean everywhere?
  -current class-outside the current class within package- outside package.

  *** Default***
  The access level is only within package.
  If we do not type any access modifier, it will be automacally default.

  *** Protected ****
  if there is not relation between classes, protected access modifier is like default.
  But if there is parent-child relation between classes, child class can reach parent class, even if it is outside the package (for data member and methods)

  ****Private***
  The access level is only within class.
  It cannot be reached from outside the class.


  **private constructor role**
  you cannot create the instance out of class.. nesne uretemezsin..

 *** method overriding***
 daha kısıtlatıcı bir access modifier olamaz..

 local variables do not take access modifiers yani metod ici değişkenler.
